# Devoir-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## I) The run_analysis.R file does:
### 1) We take the data from the Samsung project
### 2) We merge the data together of train and set 
### 3) We renamed the columns
### 4) We take just the columns of the mean ans standard deviation 
### 5) We create a new data set with the average of each variable for each subject and each activity

## II) The results of the new data set is shown in "second_tidy_data.txt"

## III) The codebook.md file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
