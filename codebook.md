# codebook 

### subject : the id of the subject 
### activity : the activity the subject was doing when measured 

### From the CodeBook we select just the variables that represents mean and standard deviation 
### We rename those variables by replacing mean by Mean, std by Std, and removing all "-" and "()"
### In the second_tidy_data data set each variable represents the average of each variable for each subject and each activity
